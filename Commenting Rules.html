<h1 style="text-align: center;">Commenting Rules</h1>
<p>There's a couple of rules that you must know about before commenting.<br>
<br>
1: Be Nice<br>
Unoriginal rule but a true rule. Don't shit on me or other commenters! No trash talk, spamming, bitching and arguing on my website!<br>
<br>
2: No rp<br>
Sucks but I would want my site to be as clean as possible.<br>
<br>
3: Identity<br>
Identify yourself with your "usuall profile" name. If you act and are named like someone I know then I'll believe you more to be one of those I know of.<br>
