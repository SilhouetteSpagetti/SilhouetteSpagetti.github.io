<h1 style="text-align: center;">Commenting Rules</h1>
<p>There's a couple of rules that you must know about before commenting.<br>
<br>
1: Sign In<br>
After a small while of thinking over this I've decided to make the comment sections login required so I can know that a commenter is the same person as the previous. I don't think the login system would be too difficult to understand as well since I had problems with it.<br>
<br>
2: Be Nice<br>
Unoriginal rule but a true rule. Don't shit on me or other commenters! No trash talk, spamming, bitching and arguing on my website!<br>
<br>
3: No rp<br>
Sucks but I would want my site to be as clean as possible.<br></p>
