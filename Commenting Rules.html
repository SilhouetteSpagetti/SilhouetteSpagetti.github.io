<h1 style="text-align: center;">Commenting Rules</h1>
<p>There's a couple of rules that you must know about before commenting. I won't reply too much/at all cause of 'certain events' happening.<br>
<br>
1: Be Nice<br>
Unoriginal rule but a true rule. Don't shit on me or other commenters! No trash talk, spamming, bitching and arguing on my website!<br>
<br>
2: No rp<br>
Sucks but I would want my site to be as clean as possible.<br>
<br>
3: Log In<br>
I changed so you must login to comment now. You might not want to but who knows.<br>
