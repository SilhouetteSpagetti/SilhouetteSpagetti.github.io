This was her last appearance pic from e621 before I deactivated my account. At least I thought I deactivated it and now I got perma banned for making a second account. (Pretty harsh punishment for something that can be a mistake isn't it?) I'm not mad about it. I wasn't mad about it until some specific event happened that was common for me.<br>

Anyway as the category description said. This reactor was a marvel and gives so much and lose so little. Also a rear.</p>
