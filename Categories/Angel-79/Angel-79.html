<img src="Angel-79.png" style="margin: 35px; width:70%;height:70%;">
<p style="margin: 35px;">The first image of her's. She was based out of Angela-45 and was a test to see if the "Owner" is gonna attack me for having a character inspired by Angela. Was posted on e621 but got removed. Was also posted on DeviantArt but I deactivated my account there later on.<br>

The background was from an Oblivion screenshot that I took for an animation a long time ago.</p>
