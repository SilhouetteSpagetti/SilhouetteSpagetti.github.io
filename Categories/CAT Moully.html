<h1 style="text-align: center;">Moully Gray</h1>
<p>Moully is a snake/dragon hybrid that was spliced in a secret lab to reinforce the moral of soldiers in battle. Something went wrong and Moully wasn't up to go to war at all and so she escaped. Somewhat work in progress but I'll try.<br>
<br>
She's kind and intelligent, knows how to fight and is a bit motherly. I might change her name to Molly later. Or not. Or later or not.</p>
