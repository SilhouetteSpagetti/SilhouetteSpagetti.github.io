<h1 style="text-align: center;">Elle The Ender Dragon</h1>
<p>A Minecraft Ender Dragon all of a sudden! Got me inspired by some character made by some sort of feather artist and PKanimations. (What happened to the guy?) Elle is talkative and thinks she's mainstream with her lols and lmaos.<br>
<br>
She's a work in progress right now so I don't have a lot for her.</p>
