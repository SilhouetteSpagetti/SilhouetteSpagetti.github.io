<p>Itch Aki is a dragon that I was making for a friend but later got to own. She sorta looks like an anthro Pokemon but she isn't actually one.<br>

Her design will change from this so she's less of a Poke. Mostly the eyes.<br>
<img src="Itch Aki/New Itch Aki.png" style="margin: 35px; width:40%;height:40%;"><br>
This is an old ref of her new design. It was denied by me at first but now I can go with it.</p>
