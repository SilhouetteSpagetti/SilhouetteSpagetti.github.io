<h1 style="text-align: center;">Cultist Lele</h1>
<p>A followed of the dark arts. Lele is mental sick, relentless and obedient to her masters. Her main weapon is a dagger in which she's skilled with but she can some fire and summoning spells as well.<br>
<br>
She was influenced by the near-naked cultists in TES2 Daggerfall. Her head is similar to an old cartoon show's style and might resemble a character from that show as well. (Not the same character btw)</p>
