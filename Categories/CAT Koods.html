<h1 style="text-align: center;">Koods the Cobra</h1>
<p>Koods is another cobra oc possibly made to breed a lot with Medea or something. He was shown in a TES4 Oblivion related pic of mine where he wished he could be in the Imperial City. Don't remember all the details about him but I remember his lust for the city.</p>
