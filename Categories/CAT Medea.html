<h1 style="text-align: center;">Medea the Cobra</h1>
<p>Medea is a happy and somewhat open Cobra girl with a massive amount of good. She's an adult but also 6 years old in Cobra years.<br>
<br>
She's quick in mood, she's mature and very creative but also pretty weak in physical form and can't fight for herself. Her attitude is kind but also flawed by an inch with a split personality. Even if it's not a big problem, Medea think it's really annoying. She doesn't have a last name since she doesn't know what it is and was taken away from her mother as an egg. She has a boyfriend called Koods which she meets and spend time with a-lot.<br>
<br>
She also has a teddy called Ziz.</p>
