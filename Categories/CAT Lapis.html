<h1 style="text-align: center;">Lapis the Kobold</h1>
<p>Lapis was a character from one of my friends. She was owned by my buddy's old friend which I don't know a lot about but that he was rude and manipulative. Lapis was gonna be removed from my buddy's list of characters until I told him that the bully can suit himself and that I can have the blue kobold lady. She was meant to only have sex with a specific character which was metaldab21's Wolf named Dex. Until the break up between him and the Lapis's creator she was allowed to bang others.<br>
<br>
Lapis is a horny sex enthusiast with magic abilities and stealth skills. Couldn't let go of drawing her since her design fitted my taste so much.</p>
