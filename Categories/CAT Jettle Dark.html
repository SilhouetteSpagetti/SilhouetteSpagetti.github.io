<h1 style="text-align: center;">Jettle Dark</h1>
<p>Jettle isn't edgy. She's just a very dark skinned Argonian with glowing red eyes.<br>
<br>
I have to admit that I only wrote Jettle's information on the web so most of her is forgotten. But her mate Bjork I still remembered. Jettle was shipped with a character owned by bjork214 on DeviantArt that I remade as an Argonian.</p>
