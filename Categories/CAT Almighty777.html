Almighty777's first reference by me<br>
<br>
<p>Almighty is a friend of mine with an incredible amount of patience to still be my friend. I don't own him, he's a person, not a character.<br>
<br>
I drew his character for him as he couldn't do that himself cause of the lack of tools. He is currently dating my daughter Eylea. Dating as in, fucking a lot. His character has a large manhood and can cum a massive amount of sperm as well as regenerating more. Making him a great playfriend for Eylea.</p>
