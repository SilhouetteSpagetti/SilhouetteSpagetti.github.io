<h1 style="text-align: center;">Alma the Cobra</h1>
<p>Alma is a new Cobra girl. She was gonna appear in a game and is the sister to Koods.<br>
<br>
She owns a shop called "The Serpents Den" where she sells mixed goods and talk to customers. She's friendly to everyone in her home town but is scared to go out to the wilderness. A wolf attacked her and bit a part of her snake hood off so she never leaves town. What the town is called I don't know.</p>
