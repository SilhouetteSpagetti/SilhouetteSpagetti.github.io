Today is your first day at work in the Reader's Longue before it closes.<br>
<br>
Groomo "Can you mop the floor while I'm searching for some tools to fix the pipes dear Pipy?"<br>
Pipy "Yes sir!"<br>
<br>

By far it's been calm and all nice in the store this time of 1PM. There was 1 customer an hour after you took the job but there will probably be another soon. Perhaps enough for the store to stay active you hope.<br>
<br>
You're still glad that Groomo gave you a chance to work for him and earn some money.<br>
<br>

<div>
<p>Almighty777 Said<br>
Willing to be flirty if the option is available</p>
</div>
<p>
<br>
<img src="img0013.gif" alt="Img0013" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
You haven't been a 'flirty' girl in 6 years and don't have any reason to be that now. Some people flirt or compliment you but you always tell them off afterwards. There's not an option to do that at work since you're the only employee it has besides Gromoo.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0014.gif" alt="Img0014" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
Wait. You're expected to flirt with Gromoo? He is nice but you don't like him exactly 'That' much. He's just a friend. Right?<br>
<br>
</p>
<div>
<p>yellowpearl64 Said<br>
Pipy must ask questions to Gromoo first, maybe he's just a friend.</p>
</div>
<p>
<br>
You should actually not ask suspicious questions to your boss, you're sure he's a friend only.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0015.gif" alt="Img0015" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
Or maybe he's faking it to get to your body? You had some people that did such 'attempts' before so it's not too far off if he's doing it too soon.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0016.gif" alt="Img0016" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
No he can't be a rapist! You heard that other Orcs hates him for his friendly personality so he can't be a bad person.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0017.gif" alt="Img0017" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
Or it's just a play to get to some really good meat that might be you?<br>
<br>
What pipes did he mean that needed to be fixed?<br>
<br>
</p>
<div>
<p>yellowpearl64 Said<br>
Is Gromoo a plumber too or maybe not?</p>
</div>
<p>
He probably only has the skills to do plumber work. Or maybe he was a plumber before? This makes you more confident that he's no criminal'like person.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0018.gif" alt="Img0018" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
You might not suspect your boss to be a bad person too much or you might cause some trouble. Is it 2PM now? Time for a break then! Make sure not to slip on the wet floor.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0019.gif" alt="Img0019" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
You got better coffee at home, but this is good enough.<br>
<br>
Also you misspelled 'Groomo' a couple of times but no harm done.<br>
<br>
</p>
<div>
<p>Almighty777 Said<br>
Perhaps check up on Groomo</p>
</div>
<p>
<br>
Well.. You could ask him if he had something planned for you and if he's being suspicious then you can bust him. But then he might suspect you being not trustworhty enough to stay and will probably leave you unpayed.<br>
<br>
Maybe let's be calm and don't think too much about it? You're on a break after all.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0020.gif" alt="Img0020" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
He still haven't found the tools? You haven't seen him come out of the personnel area yet.<br>
<br>
</p>
<div>
<p>yellowpearl64 Said<br>
Go to the personnel area</p>
</div>
<p>
<br>
You start to get worried now. Maybe he's on the floor in pain or already dead? It's possible! Isn't it? Who's gonna pay you then?<br>
<br>
<img src="img0021.gif" alt="Img0021" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
Agh! Now you're doing this again! How the fuck are you this paranoid? He could've taken another route out to fix the pipes!<br>
<br>
<img src="img0022.gif" alt="Img0022" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
But it's important to show responsibility in your workplace so you have to go. Maybe there's no exit from the personnel area as well so he's still there? Or he's unable to find the tools? Whatever. Let's go take a look and see if he needs help.<br>
<br>
<img src="img0023.gif" alt="Img0023" style="width:50%;height:50%;"><br>
<br>
That came from the main entrance area...<br>
<br>
You remembered that there was a backdoor that he could take. And that someone said to you that Groomo's bones where fragile...<br>
<br>
<br>
Shit.<br>
<br>

<p>
--- Pipy is ---<br>
A tad too paranoid.<br>
Not flirty or easily attracted to others.<br>
More willing to use violence than diplomacy.<br>
Way more centered on getting her own life fixed.<br>
<br>
These are character traits and not options to use btw.<br>
