<p>Edited practice version of the gif. How did I do this? An editor? No I used FFMPEG and audacity only(Tho I made an extended version of the original gif in an editor first)! The process was as follows.<br>
<br>
I made a longer version and used an FFMPEG command to draw text on the video showing the current frame in it.<br>
I opened up Audacity and used the edited video to see which frame I should put a sound effect in. (Remember to set the timecode in the time viewer to 25 frames)
Recompiled another version of the video with the audacity made sound file with FFMPEG. The audio was put into the mp4!<br>
<br>
I put effort into my work even if you don't know it.<br>
