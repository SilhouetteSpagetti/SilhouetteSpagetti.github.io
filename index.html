Before going over to the categories you might need to be aware of somethings.<br>
<br>
This site is to contain NotGod made fetish art drawn and animated by me(NotGodOkay). I've drawn other artists characters and some official characters and I don't own them nor do I want to earn from them alone. You are free to draw my characters and even upload the images from this site to other sites but you also need to give me credit if you draw or reupload my art and characters. Stealing is no good and will give you consequences no matter if you want it or not. Jesus fucking Christ man. (A funny)<br>
<br>
Now go and see.
